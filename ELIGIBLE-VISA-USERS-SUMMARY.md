## ðŸ’¾ Files Generated

1. **eligible-visa-users-generated.json** - Detailed generation results
2. **eligible-visa-reference.json** - Lookup table with eligibility profiles

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing

Every visa type now has an eligible user who can:
- âœ… **Register successfully**
- âœ… **Complete profile with appropriate information**
- âœ… **Pass through interview system**
- âœ… **Receive correct visa recommendations**

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps Options

### Option 1: Keep Both User Sets
- **Testing0XXX**: Original users (some ineligible)
- **Testing1XXX**: New eligible users
- Use Testing1XXX for accurate visa pathway testing

### Option 2: Update Original Users (SQL Approach)
If you prefer to fix the original Testing0XXX users, I can create SQL scripts to:
- Update nationality for country-specific visas
- Adjust ages for age-dependent visas
- Change marital status for family visas
- Set appropriate locations

Would you like me to create SQL update scripts for the original users, or should we proceed with the new Testing1XXX eligible users for testing?

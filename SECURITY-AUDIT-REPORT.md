# NPM Security Audit Report
**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND

## Summary
- **Projects Affected**: All 3 (shared-ui, l4h, cannlaw)
- **Vulnerability Count**: 4 moderate severity across all projects
- **Primary Issue**: esbuild <=0.24.2 security flaw

## Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. esbuild <=0.24.2 (MODERATE - CRITICAL FOR DEV)
- **CVE**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Impact**: Any website can send requests to development server and read responses
- **Risk Level**: HIGH in development environment
- **Affected Packages**: esbuild, vite, vite-node, vitest

### 2. Development Server Exposure
- **Risk**: External websites could access dev server
- **Data at Risk**: Source code, API responses, database queries
- **Environment**: Development only (not production)

## Remediation Options

### Option A: Force Update (BREAKING CHANGES)
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```
**Pros**: Fixes all vulnerabilities immediately
**Cons**: Vite 5.4.20 â†’ 7.1.5 (major version jump, potential breaking changes)

### Option B: Manual Package Updates
```bash
npm update esbuild
npm update vite@^6.0.0
```
**Pros**: More controlled upgrade path
**Cons**: May not fully resolve all vulnerabilities

### Option C: Development Server Hardening
- Run dev server on localhost only (already doing)
- Use firewall rules to block external access
- Use VPN/isolated network for development

## Recommended Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. âœ… **NPM Cache Flushed** - Completed
2. ðŸ”„ **Test Breaking Changes** - Run on isolated branch first
3. ðŸ”„ **Backup Current State** - Before major updates

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
1. **Create backup branch**
2. **Test Vite 7.x upgrade on shared-ui first**
3. **Verify build processes still work**
4. **Update other projects if successful**
5. **Document any breaking changes**

## Security Measures Implemented
- âœ… NPM cache cleared and verified
- âœ… All development processes stopped
- âœ… Audit completed on all projects
- ðŸ”„ Vulnerability patching in progress

## Risk Assessment
- **Development Environment**: HIGH RISK (external request vulnerability)
- **Production Environment**: NO RISK (different build process)
- **Data Exposure**: Source code, API keys, database content

## Next Steps
1. Proceed with controlled upgrade testing
2. Implement additional dev server security
3. Establish ongoing security monitoring

# ðŸ”Œ API Architecture & Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the API strategy for both Law4Hire and Cannlaw platforms, including mobile app endpoints, authentication, and AI orchestration.

## Structure

- RESTful endpoints with versioning (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)
- JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- Shared API layer for mobile and web clients
- AI orchestration endpoints for intake, document automation, and chat

## Key Modules

| Module             | Endpoint Prefix | Notes                          |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Intake             | `/api/intake`    | AI-assisted form logic         |
| Case Management    | `/api/cases`     | CRUD + workflow triggers       |
| Document Automation| `/api/docs`      | Template engine + AI fill-in   |
| AI Orchestration   | `/api/ai`        | Routing to OpenAI / Vertex AI  |

## Security

- HTTPS enforced
- Rate limiting and abuse detection
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Next Steps

- Finalize OpenAPI spec
- Implement mock endpoints for mobile dev
- Begin integration testing with AI services

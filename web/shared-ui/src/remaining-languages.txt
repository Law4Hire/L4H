This file is a temporary holder to help me structure the remaining languages. The remaining languages that need to be added are:
- French (fr-FR)
- Hindi (hi-IN)
- Indonesian (id-ID)
- Italian (it-IT)
- Japanese (ja-JP)
- Korean (ko-KR)
- Marathi (mr-IN)
- Polish (pl-PL)
- Portuguese (pt-PT)
- Russian (ru-RU)
- Tamil (ta-IN)
- Telugu (te-IN)
- Turkish (tr-TR)
- Urdu (ur-PK)
- Vietnamese (vi-VN)
- Chinese (zh-CN)

I need to add complete translation resources for each of these languages with all the required namespaces.
